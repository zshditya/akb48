                        JKT48 (read as "J. K. T. forty-eight") is an Indonesian-Japanese idol girl group whose name is derived from its based city of Jakarta and the Japanese idol group AKB48. Formed in 2011, the group is the first AKB48 sister group outside Japan and adopts the concept of "idols you can meet", before switching to "idols that will come to meet you" since April 8, 2018.

                        BNK48 (read B.N.K. Forty-eight) is a Thai idol girl group and the third international sister group of Japan's AKB48, following Indonesia's JKT48 and China's SNH48 (former).

Its second single, "Khukki Siangthai", released on 20 December 2017, was a great success. As of March 2023, the group has 43 members.

                        The group is named after Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, where its theatre, BNK48 the Campus, is located. Orchid, a flower popular in the country, serves as both the colour and motif of the group.

                    A few days after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami, AKB48's official blog reported that that a sum of more than 617 million yen had been donated to the Japanese Red Cross Society. On April 1, the group issued a digital charity single titled "Dareka no Tame ni (What Can I Do for Someone?)", all profit from which was donated to a 2011 earthquake and tsunami relief fund. AKB48's 23rd single "Kaze wa Fuiteiru" was also dedicated to the 2011 tsunami victims, its title song's lyrics having been written with the intention of cheering up the Japanese people who were affected by the March 11 disaster.

                    In February 2012, the group announced another donation to the Japanese Red Cross, of over 580 million yen. It was reported that to date AKB48 had raised a total of over 1.25 billion yen for the earthquake and tsunami relief.
